;; StreamBridge - Advanced Bidirectional Payment Channels
;;
;; A revolutionary trustless payment infrastructure enabling instant, cost-effective
;; microtransactions through sophisticated state channel technology. StreamBridge
;; eliminates blockchain congestion by moving frequent payments off-chain while
;; maintaining cryptographic security guarantees.
;;
;; KEY INNOVATIONS:
;; - Lightning-fast off-chain payment routing between any two parties
;; - Zero-fee microtransactions with unlimited transaction throughput  
;; - Cryptographically secured dispute resolution with economic incentives
;; - Flexible channel lifecycle management with cooperative & forced exits
;; - Battle-tested security model with comprehensive input sanitization
;; - Emergency recovery mechanisms for exceptional circumstances
;;
;; BUSINESS VALUE:
;; StreamBridge powers next-generation applications requiring instant payments:
;; streaming services, IoT micropayments, gaming economies, and real-time
;; content monetization. Perfect for high-frequency trading systems and
;; peer-to-peer marketplaces demanding instant settlement.
